<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>News for release 0.3</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>After quite a while I finally found  time and strength
to port dvdmenu to Qt4. So not much of a news, you may but
nevertheless, the happy owners of a Qt4.4 installation can now enjoy
dvdmenu as well.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>As usual, any feedback will be appreciated.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>News for release 0.2</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I wasn't satisfied with the way that ImageMagick
converted my pictures, so I decided to write the conversion with
Qt.<BR>The result is that the dependency to ImageMagick is gone, and
that you will get menus that look exactly like the preview. Also it
is much faster.<BR><BR>I also improved the way projects are saved and
loaded, though it's not yet perfect, and corrected minor bugs.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>History</H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>Though many front-ends to dvdauthor exists and
sometimes do a good job at creating nice dvd menus, I had complaints
for every one of them :<BR>- KMediaFactory : the nicest one of all
dvdauthor frontends, but it's painfully slow and you must create
chapter menus, and the tool insist on muxing subtitles itself.<BR>-
KDE DVD Author Wizard : a nice one too, but also slow and not very
friendly<BR>- QDvdAuthor : a promising tool but overcomplicated<BR>-
DVDStyler : a GTK based tool, both complicated and not powerful
enough<BR><BR>So my goal was to create a tool that would easily and
rapidly make a nice dvd menu.<BR>It works like this :<BR>- You create
a new dvd, and choose the temporary directory for it.<BR>- You add a
title to the dvd and choose its name, a picture for the menu, aspect,
audio languages (up to 2), subtitle languages (up to 4)<BR>- Then you
add the video files to the title and you can specify the chaptering
for each file.<BR>- You can also select a background image and a
music for the menu.<BR>- Click &quot;Preview&quot; to see what you
menu will look like<BR>- Click &quot;Encode&quot; to generate the dvd
structure in the DVD directory of the temporary directory.<BR>- Use
xine or ogle to preview your dvd and burn it with k3b.<BR><BR>Design
is like the dvdaudio tool, here is what it looks like :<BR><IMG SRC="dvdmenu1.jpg" NAME="images1" ALT="Screenshot of dvdmenu" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=697 HEIGHT=377 BORDER=0><BR><BR>And
here is what you final menu will look like :<BR><BR>&lt;insert
screenshot here&gt;<BR><BR>dvdmenu will generate a four titles menu
page. If you have more than four titles, it will generate a &quot;Next&quot;
button to access the second menu.<BR>To ease the creation, I suggest
that you prepare snapshots of your movies before launching
dvdmenu.<BR>You will find that with this, you only need a few seconds
to generate your menu.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Dependencies :</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>- dvdauthor<BR>- mjpegtools<BR>- netpbm<BR>- Qt</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Installation</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B><BR></B>$ tar zxvf dvdmenu-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz<BR>$
cd dvdmenu-&lt;version&gt;<BR>$ qmake dvdmenu.pro<BR>$ make<BR>$ make
install</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Notes :</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It's a very early release, probably full of bugs, but
it works for me so maybe it will be usefull to you. As usual, there
is no warranty of any kind !<BR>It only generate PAL menu. But you
can add NTSC video files and thus create a mixed dvd, if your
standalone dvd player supports it.</P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Known bugs :</B></H3>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>None at the moment.</B></P>
