Install is really simple. Copy dvdbak and dvdbak.common to some place like /usr/local/bin:

sudo cp dvdbak* /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/dvdbak

Then make sure all the tools are installed (ubuntu example):
sudo apt-get install vobcopy ddrescue growisofs dvdbackup dvdauthor vlc mplayer \
 genisoimage transcode wodim dvdrip 

Also you will need to make sure libdvdread and libdvdcss is installed if you 
need to handle encrypted disks. 
 
It may be illegal for you to use decryption software in your location, and I highly 
recommend that you do not use this if it is forbidden for you.


Handbrake can be found below, and is highly recommended, since it correctly detects
the main menu title most of the time.

You only need HandBrakeCLI installed - the GUI is not necessary.
